# FitnessTracker

A Java-based console application, the Fitness Tracker project was created in two stages as a component of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) course.  Individual fitness data, such as name, age, weight, steps done, and calories burnt, may be managed by users of the system.  While Phase 2 concentrated on software testing using JUnit to ensure that the developed features performed properly, Phase 1's objective was to build a working menu system and fundamental logic for data operations.

The program was built with a fully interactive and validated menu. Main.java for application logic and menu flow, FitnessRecord.java for the data model. This menu allows users to perform essential CRUD operations: creating new fitness records, reading/displaying data, updating existing entries, and removing records. The application loops continuously until the user selects the exit option and does not accept invalid menu inputs. Records are displayed in an easily legible format when the option to show the data has been selected.  Every input area is checked to make sure no incorrect information is entered or results in the application crashing, including name, age, weight, steps, and calories.  Additionally, a custom feature that computes and shows the average number of steps taken by all users presently logged into the system was implemented.  Every function was effectively shown with appropriate structure and commentary.

In Software Testing, a separate test class named MainTest.java was created using JUnit 5. This test suite includes unit tests to verify that fitness records can be added to a list, removed from the list, and updated correctly. It also confirms that the custom feature (average step calculation) performs accurate calculations. Additionally, the test suite includes functionality to simulate file loading from a text file, ensuring that fitness records are parsed and loaded properly into the system. Each test is isolated and uses a setup method to initialize test data before execution. Assertions are used to confirm the correctness of each feature.
